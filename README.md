"# Stream-Modeling-Monitoring-Toolbox" 

The Stream Modeling/Monitoring Toolbox allows the user to extract a large amount of stream data from only a LiDAR derived DEM. 

ArcMap is required to use this toolbox. In order to get any data, the user must have a LiDAR derived DEM of the area for which they want to acquire stream data. If the user does not have one, LiDAR datasets are becoming increasingly avaialbe for free download on the web. An example of a site that provides free LiDAR data: http://www.msdis.missouri.edu/data/lidar/index.html .

To get started with the tool, download the zip file and follow the steps in the guide document.
